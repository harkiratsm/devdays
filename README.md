## Difficulty Faced

### Why I thought of building a web app ?

In my freshman year , I wanted to learn and try new Tech stack . I came across a famous Framework ReactJs and I loved this framework and learnt by building small project .

### Why a food Ordering App ?

I want to build a app where I can learn different thing at a same time while building this application . Used various technologies at same application and building this app was a fun üòä .

### Bugs time ?

Bugs are a part of building a app . Really while solving this bugs I learnt new things . Also being part of various community , I help other DEV to solve there bugs and I also get benefitted from it when I am stucked at Bug.

#### What if bug not found on StackOverflow ?

Once , I was stucked in bug but found no solution on stackOverflow that would help me , from a github discussion I found a solution that worked for me and I posted that answer on StackOverflow .
